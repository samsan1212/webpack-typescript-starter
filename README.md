# Webpack Typescript Starter #

Love **Webpack**? Love **Typescript**? Feel frustrated of starting a Webpack + Typescript project?

Webpack Typescript Starter comes to help!!

## Philosophy ##

Webpack Typescript Starter aims to ease the pain of setting Webpack + Typescript project.

With this starter, you can easily set up a 
* NodeJS project
* Frontend project
* Small script migrating to an existing HTML template engine

Although Webpack Typescript Starter can be the starter of a frontend project,
it **does not compete** with those wonderful frontend starters, e.g. 
[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), 
[GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), 
[VueJS CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/),
[Angular](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local)

Webpack Typescript Starter only provide an enviornment of Webpack + Typescript,

and letting you guys do your magic in there :wink:
