Webpack Typescript Starter comes to help!!

## Philosophy ##

Webpack Typescript Starter aims to ease the pain of setting Webpack + Typescript project.

With this starter, you can easily set up a 
* NodeJS project
* Frontend project
* Small script migrating to an existing HTML template engine

Although Webpack Typescript Starter can be the starter of a frontend project,
it **does not compete** with those wonderful frontend starters, e.g. 
[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), 
[GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), 
[VueJS CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/),
[Angular](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local)
